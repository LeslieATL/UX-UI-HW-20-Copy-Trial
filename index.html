            <h3>Manage your hydroponic farm with Logit</h3>
            <p>
                Logit is a mobile app for new hydroponic farmers looking for a way to keep up with crop maintenance and learning about managing their farms. Logit is a hackathon submission for the Calgary Maker Faire that placed 2nd place.

                    <p>This May I had the opportunity to participate in the Calgary Maker Fair designathon alongside talented Canadian students. Our prompt was to design a user interface for hydroponic farming. From May 3-5 I had the honor to meet other participants, research, wireframe, prototype and pitch my project remotely to the judge panel.</p>

                <h3>How might we design a sleek and intuitive interface to help users maintain a hydroponic farm?</h3>
                <p>Throughout my research, I felt overwhelmed with the amount of steps a farmer would need to perform in order to maintain a healthy farm. Logit would help these users struggling to keep up with things such as crop scheduling and crop maintenance and help them maintain a healthy farm.</p>

            <p>We were advised to design 3-5 screens with one of them being hi-fidelity. I chose screens that would highlight the main tasks a user can perform in Logit such as the main screen with the system display, how I intended for the digital logbook to look like and how users would make changes in Logit</p>

            <h3>Project pitching: the experience</h3>
            <p>Pitching the project live was nerve wracking and I had a few minutes to sell Logit as a product but also showcase my design thinking skills. How I approached the experience was balancing my design process, the product and talk about future iterations as I went on. Overall I think sprinkling in my thought process and being honest about what I knew or did not know helped Logit shine alongside the design thinking and solving a problem in the hydroponic farming space. Finally, I think there is something special about pitching live even though I was nervous, I think it made me go hard on highlighting my work!</p>        </div>

                <p>This screen went through color adjustements and sizes adjustements. The orginal felt static and unrealistic so I opten for smaller squares and no picture. I also struggled with finding a way to add new plants to the system so in the second round I went for a minimalistic plus button.</p>

                <p>This screen went through color adjustements and sizes adjustements as well. Through iterations I wanted to play around with style a little bit with the aim of making it fun.

            <h3>Reflections & Future opportunities</h3>
            <p>During my pitching I explained how I only had assumptions for the empathizing phase as I did not conduct research. Recently, I learned from a mentor how personas, and journey maps hold value when validated. With that being said, for future opportunities I would want to research and understand the problem space more from hydroponic farmers and confirm or deny my hypothesis. I also explained that this would help me better understand the needs of hydroponic farmers and explain some of my questions such as: “do all farmers keep a log book or feel a need for one?” This would make Logit a worthy tool for hydroponic farmers across the globe.</p>
